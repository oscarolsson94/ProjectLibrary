# ProjectLibrary
Library project assignment.

The user is given a number of possible operations just as in a normal library system. Such as maintain a registry, add to the registry, check in/check out books/movies  etc.
The application makes use of serialization to save its current state. It will therefore save all of your progress and keep track of your inventory
until you open the app again.

To run the app, download the following classes: 

Main,
Library,
Customer,
Masterpiece,
Movie,
Book.

Proceed to run the program from the Main-class. From there on, follow the instructions given by the program.

You can download the .ser-files if you want, that will give you an initialized inventory.
If you choose not to, these files will be created upon running the application for the first time.
